    "     When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance. The derived class inherits all the features of the base case. Syntax: Class Base1: Body of the class Class Base2: Body of the class Class Derived(Base1, Base2): Body of the class\n",
    "    Inheritence is nothing but reusing the code of Parent class by the child class. Similary when a child class inherits its properties from multiple Parent classes this scenario is called Multiple Inheritence"
